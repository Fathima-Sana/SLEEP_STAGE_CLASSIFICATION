# Sleep Stage Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify sleep stages using deep learning techniques. By analyzing sleep data, we aim to classify different stages of sleep, such as REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep, and wakefulness.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing sleep data collected from SleepEDF of physionet. The dataset includes various features such as EEG signals, EOG signals, EMG signals, and more, which are used for classifying sleep stages.

## Methodology
We employ machine learning algorithms such as DeepSleepNet, SleepEEGNet, AttnSleep to train models on the sleep data. Feature engineering techniques are utilized to extract relevant information from the raw sleep data. The trained models are then used for sleep stage classification.
